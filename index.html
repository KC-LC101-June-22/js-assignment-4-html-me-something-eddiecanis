            This is a story on what I like my art website to look like.
      I been doing clay sculture for a while. I been doing this with the hope of making people day a little brighter and to work out my own feelings.
      I really hope to one day develop a side job that i can do in my retirement.

      Money, time and space has been a hinderice in really expanding the hobby.  It with a eye on these problem that I am working on a job to give me the space (budget and time) to work on things.
